# osm2vectortiles

This package converts the osm data in geojson format into different layers (defined into different layers) of data in geojson format. By using tippecanoe, the layers are converted into vector tiles (in .mbtiles format). A map server is set up for map service (for larger map, this is faster than directly using geojson data on convas).
